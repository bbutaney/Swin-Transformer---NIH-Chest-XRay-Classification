# Swin-Transformer---NIH-Chest-XRay-Classification
The two uploaded notebooks were run in Google Colab to train/test a Swin Transformer for image classification on the NIH dataset of ~100k chest x-rays.

This is a multiclass, multilabel problem, with images being classified as showing one or more of 15 diseases.
